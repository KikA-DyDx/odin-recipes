    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nsala soup (white soup) is one of the most delicious soups in Nigeria.<br>

        Ofe nsala, as we call it, is a delicacy in Igboland.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Small dawadawa</li>
        <li>Snails (Optional)</li>
        <li>3 seasoning cubes</li>
        <li>1.3KG / 3lb Chicken</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Uziza seeds</li>
        <li>Ground crayfish (1 cup)</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced uziza leaves</li>
        <li>A handful sliced utazi leaves</li>
        <li>Dried or smoked fish (two medium sizes)</li>
        <li>Yam (six to eight slicesâ€¦baby fist size)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Yam: Peel, boil, and pound the yam using a mortar and pestle. This will serve as the thickener for the nsala soup.</li>
        <li>Grind Ingredients: Combine crayfish, uziza seeds, and dawadawa, then grind them into a powder. Wash and slice the leaves.</li>
        <li>Clean the Snails: Wash snails with lemon or lime juice to remove the slimy fluid. Some people cook snails with the fluid or shell intact.</li>
        <li>Parboil the Chicken/Meat: Season chicken (or assorted meat) with seasoning cubes, salt, onions, ginger, and garlic. Parboil for 7 minutes until soft. Add washed dry fish if using, along with 3 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Boil Ingredients Together: Cook the meat, fish, and water mixture for 7-10 minutes until soft. Add the ground crayfish, uziza seed, dawadawa, and red pepper (if needed). Adjust seasoning with more salt or cubes if necessary.</li>
        <li>Add Pounded Yam: Gradually add the pounded yam to the soup, letting it dissolve to thicken. Adjust the amount for your preferred soup consistency.</li>
        <li>Add Leaves: Stir in the sliced uziza and utazi leaves sparingly for a light bitter flavor. Simmer for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the finished nsala soup with pounded yam, fufu, or eba.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong><em>This is how you make the best Nsala Soup (Ofe Nsala) with lumps, the kind you only find in posh restaurants and eateries. <br>

        You can serve with eba or fufu, in fact, any of the Nigerian swallows will make an impressive combination</em></strong></p>
